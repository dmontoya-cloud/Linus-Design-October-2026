# Agentic Engineering Operating Model

**Document type:** Controlled process document**Owner:** CTO / Head of Engineering**Audience:** All engineering staff, AI agents (Claude, Codex), QA, and auditors**Compliance scope:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 secure development controls**Version:** 1.0 (initial)**Review cycle:** Quarterly, or on any material change to tooling or controls

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how we build software using a **human-led, AI-assisted** development model. It establishes the roles, the unit of work (the _PoD_), the lifecycle, the mandatory control gates, and the evidence we keep so the process is auditable and ISO/IEC 27001-aligned.

The model is built around a single principle: **AI accelerates execution; humans own judgement and accountability.** Nothing in this process transfers decision authority, sign-off, or accountability to an AI agent.

## 2. Scope

Applies to all production code, infrastructure-as-code, and customer-facing documentation produced by the engineering organisation. It does not apply to throwaway spikes or research notebooks that never reach a shared branch — but any artefact promoted toward production must enter this process at Phase 1.

## 3. Operating principles

These principles are binding and override convenience. Where the process and a principle appear to conflict, the principle wins and the conflict is escalated to the document owner.

1. **Human-led, AI-assisted.** A human lead owns every PoD. AI agents produce drafts and candidates; humans decide.
2. **Judgement stays with humans.** Architecture, requirements, trade-offs, risk acceptance, and all sign-offs are human acts. They are never delegated to an AI.
3. **Separation of duties between agents.** The agent that _writes_ code is never the sole agent that _reviews_ it. Claude builds; Codex independently reviews and authors adversarial tests; a human approves. This mirrors author/reviewer segregation and is a control, not a style choice.
4. **No guessing.** When an AI agent is uncertain, missing context, or facing ambiguity, it must **stop and ask the human** rather than assume. A wrong assumption that ships is worse than a question that delays.
5. **Documented remediation.** Every review — human or AI — produces findings, and every finding has a recorded disposition (fixed, accepted with rationale, or deferred with owner and date). No silent drops.
6. **Traceability end to end.** Requirement → design → commit → review → test → documentation are linked through Azure DevOps work items, so any shipped line of code traces back to an approved requirement.
7. **The gate is human merge approval.** CI and AI review inform the decision; they do not replace it. Merge is blocked until a human approves.

## 4. The 80/20 execution split

Coding effort is split so humans spend their time where judgement matters most.

- **~80% — Claude (C):** scaffolding, boilerplate, CRUD, glue code, well-specified functions, mechanical refactors, and first-draft implementations of agreed designs.
- **~20% or more — Human (H):** the judgement-heavy core — security-sensitive logic, novel algorithms, concurrency and consistency decisions, public API contracts, and anything where a wrong call is expensive or hard to reverse.

The split is a guideline, not a quota. The human lead decides per PoD what they retain — some PoDs are 95/5, a security-critical PoD may be 50/50. The chosen split is recorded in the PoD design sign-off so reviewers know what to expect.

## 5. Roles and responsibilities

| Code  | Role                                          | Owns                                                                                                                 | Never does                                                      |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **H** | Human Lead (engineer accountable for the PoD) | Architecture, requirements, trade-off decisions, code review, all sign-offs, risk acceptance, final accountability   | Delegate sign-off to an agent                                   |
| **C** | Claude (builder)                              | First-draft code (~80%), reading review output and proposing remediation, drafting documentation, asking when unsure | Approve a merge, accept a risk, review its own code as the gate |
| **X** | Codex (independent reviewer & test author)    | Independent code review and findings report, authoring tests beyond the happy path, regression coverage              | Generate the production code it reviews, approve a merge        |

### 5.1 RACI per lifecycle activity

| Activity                              | H       | C     | X     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| Architecture & requirements           | **A/R** | C     | I     |
| Design feedback & edge-case surfacing | A       | **R** | C     |
| Requirements sign-off                 | **A/R** | I     | I     |
| Code generation (80%)                 | A/C     | **R** | I     |
| Code (judgement-heavy 20%)            | **A/R** | C     | I     |
| Human code review & sign-off          | **A/R** | I     | I     |
| Independent AI review                 | A       | C     | **R** |
| Remediation proposal                  | A       | **R** | C     |
| Remediation approval                  | **A/R** | I     | I     |
| Test authoring (adversarial)          | A       | C     | **R** |
| PR raise & CI                         | A       | **R** | C     |
| Merge approval                        | **A/R** | I     | I     |
| Documentation draft                   | A       | **R** | I     |
| Documentation review & sign-off       | **A/R** | I     | I     |

_A = Accountable, R = Responsible, C = Consulted, I = Informed._ Accountability never sits with C or X.

## 6. What is a PoD?

A **PoD (Pod of Delivery)** is the atomic unit of this operating model. It has two inseparable dimensions:

1. **The constellation** — exactly one Human Lead plus the two AI agents (Claude as builder, Codex as reviewer/test author). One human, two agents, one accountable owner.
2. **The scope** — a single bounded, independently shippable slice of work: a vertical feature, a service, a well-defined module, or a contained change set. A PoD is small enough that one human can hold the whole design in their head and personally sign off on every gate.

### 6.1 Why "Pod" and not "ticket" or "team"

A traditional ticket is just a unit of _work_. A traditional pod is a unit of _people_. A PoD fuses them: it is the smallest grouping where a human and their AI agents jointly own a deliverable end to end, from requirements through to documented, tested, merged code.

This matters because accountability has to attach to a _person_, not a queue. Every PoD has a name on it. If you can't point to the single human accountable for a PoD, the PoD is mis-scoped.

### 6.2 How a PoD is used

- **Sizing.** Scope a PoD so it can pass through the full lifecycle (Section 7) in a small number of days. If a PoD is too large for one human to review every gate meaningfully, split it. Oversized PoDs defeat the human-led control.
- **Ownership.** One Human Lead per PoD. They may lead several PoDs, but each PoD has exactly one accountable lead.
- **Tracking.** Each PoD maps to one Azure DevOps Feature (or Epic for larger efforts), with child work items for requirements, implementation, review findings, tests, and documentation. See Section 10.
- **Isolation.** Each PoD develops on its own feature branch and produces its own PR. PoDs do not share branches.
- **Closure.** A PoD is closed only when every gate is signed off, every review finding has a disposition, tests pass in CI, documentation is approved, and the work items are linked and complete.

### 6.3 Anatomy of a PoD

```
PoD: "Customer export API"
├── Human Lead: A. Engineer (accountable)
├── Claude (builder)
├── Codex (reviewer + test author)
├── Azure DevOps Feature #1234
│   ├── Requirement work items (signed off)
│   ├── Implementation tasks
│   ├── Review-finding work items (with dispositions)
│   ├── Test tasks
│   └── Documentation task
├── Git feature branch: feature/1234-customer-export
```

## 7. The PoD lifecycle

The lifecycle is a sequence of phases, each ending in a recorded artefact and — where judgement is involved — a human sign-off. The canonical flow:

```
For each PoD:

Phase 1  H ──── architecture & requirements ───────▶ C
H ◀─── feedback & considerations ────────── C     (repeat until sign-off)
H ──── requirements sign-off ─────────────▶ C

Phase 2  C ──── generates code (~80%) ────────────▶ GitHub (local + remote)
H ──── implements judgement-heavy (~20%) ▶ GitHub
C ──── asks H whenever unsure ───────────▶ H      (no guessing)

Phase 3  H ──── human review & sign-off ──────────  (merge-blocking gate)

Phase 4  X ──── independent review & findings ────▶ report
C ──── reads report, proposes remediation ▶ H
H ──── approves remediation ──────────────  C/H apply & log

Phase 5  X ──── authors tests (beyond happy path) ▶ GitHub
CI ─── coverage & quality thresholds checked

Phase 6  PR raised  ── merge BLOCKED on human review
CI runs on the PR and on every push (regression catch)

Phase 7  C ──── drafts documentation update ──────▶ H
H ──── reviews & signs off docs ──────────  commit

Phase 8  H ──── close PoD: all gates green, audit trail complete
```

### Phase 1 — Architecture & requirements (human-led)

The Human Lead gives Claude the architecture and requirements. Claude responds with **feedback and considerations** — ambiguities, missing acceptance criteria, edge cases, security implications, and risks — but does **not** start building. This repeats until the human is satisfied and **signs off**. The signed-off requirements and design notes are recorded against the Azure DevOps Feature._Control intent: requirements and architecture are human decisions (A.8.26, A.8.27)._

### Phase 2 — Implementation (AI-assisted, human-led)

Claude generates roughly 80% of the code on the PoD's feature branch and pushes to GitHub (local and remote). The Human Lead implements the judgement-heavy remainder. Whenever Claude is unsure — ambiguous requirement, multiple valid designs, missing context, a security-sensitive choice — it **stops and asks the human**. Guessing is a process violation._Control intent: secure coding with human ownership of sensitive logic (A.8.28)._

### Phase 3 — Human review & sign-off (gate)

The Human Lead reviews the combined code. This is a **merge-blocking** human gate. Output is either sign-off or specific change requests routed back to Phase 2._Control intent: author/reviewer separation; human approval before progression (A.5.3, A.8.32)._

### Phase 4 — Independent AI review & remediation (Codex)

Codex independently reviews the code and produces a **findings report** (correctness, security, complexity, error handling, style). Codex did not write this code, which is what makes its review independent. Claude reads the report and **proposes remediation** for each finding. The Human Lead **approves** the remediation plan; Claude and/or the human apply it. Every finding gets a disposition in the remediation log (see the `remediation-loop` skill)._Control intent: independent review and documented vulnerability handling (A.8.8, A.8.28)._

### Phase 5 — Test authoring (Codex)

Codex authors unit and integration tests that go **beyond the happy path** — boundary values, error and exception paths, invalid input, security-relevant cases, and concurrency where applicable. Tests are committed to the branch. Coverage and quality thresholds are enforced in CI._Control intent: security testing in development (A.8.29); test data handled per A.8.33._

### Phase 6 — Pull request & CI

A PR is raised into the protected branch. Branch protection **blocks merge until a human approves**. CI runs on the PR and on **every push** to catch regressions. Required CI checks must be green before merge is permitted. See Section 9._Control intent: change management and regression control (A.8.32)._

### Phase 7 — Documentation (AI-drafted, human-reviewed)

Claude drafts the documentation update (API docs, runbook, changelog, architecture decision record). The Human Lead reviews and **signs off**. Approved documentation is committed with the change._Control intent: maintained, reviewed documentation as part of the SDLC (A.8.25)._

### Phase 8 — Closure

The PoD closes only when: all gates signed off, all review findings dispositioned, CI green, documentation approved, and Azure DevOps work items linked and complete. The audit trail is now self-contained and traceable.

---

## 8. Control gates summary

A gate is a point where progression is blocked until a condition is met. The two human gates are non-negotiable and cannot be satisfied by any AI agent.

| #   | Gate                   | Type          | Pass condition                               | Blocking?            |
| --- | ---------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| G1  | Requirements sign-off  | Human         | Human Lead approves requirements & design    | Yes                  |
| G2  | Human code review      | Human         | Human Lead approves the code                 | Yes (merge)          |
| G3  | Independent AI review  | Agent (Codex) | Findings reported and each dispositioned     | Yes (advisory to G4) |
| G4  | Remediation approval   | Human         | Human Lead approves dispositions             | Yes                  |
| G5  | Tests & coverage       | CI            | Adversarial tests present; thresholds met    | Yes                  |
| G6  | CI green               | CI            | All required checks pass on PR + latest push | Yes (merge)          |
| G7  | Documentation sign-off | Human         | Human Lead approves docs                     | Yes                  |

**Merge requires, at minimum: G2 + G6 simultaneously satisfied, with G3/G4/G5/G7 complete.** No agent can approve the merge; branch protection enforces a human reviewer.

---

## 9. Source control & CI configuration

### 9.1 Branch protection (on the protected branch, e.g. `main`)

- Require a pull request before merging.
- Require **at least one human approving review**; agents cannot satisfy this.
- Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed.
- Require all designated **CI status checks to pass** before merge.
- Require the branch to be up to date before merge.
- Require linear history (or your chosen merge strategy) and signed commits where feasible (A.8.4 — access to and integrity of source code).
- Restrict who can push to the protected branch.

### 9.2 CI triggers

- **On pull request:** full test suite, coverage gate, static analysis / SAST, dependency vulnerability scan, secret scanning, lint.
- **On every push to the PR branch:** the same suite, so regressions are caught as they are introduced, not only at merge time.
- A failing required check leaves the PR un-mergeable regardless of approvals.

### 9.3 Required checks (recommended baseline)

Build, unit + integration tests, coverage threshold, SAST, dependency/SCA scan, secret scan, and lint/format. Tune thresholds per team, but record them so they are auditable.

---

## 10. Traceability model (Azure DevOps)

Traceability lets any auditor walk from a shipped line of code back to the approved requirement, and forward from a requirement to its tests and documentation.

```
Epic (large effort)
└── Feature  ── one PoD
    ├── Requirement / PBI  ── signed off at G1
    ├── Task: implementation (links commits/PR)
    ├── Bug/Issue: review finding  ── one per finding, with disposition
    ├── Task: test authoring  ── links test commits
    └── Task: documentation  ── signed off at G7
```

Rules:

- Every PoD = one Feature (or Epic→Feature for large work).
- Every commit message and PR references its work item ID (e.g. `AB#1234`) so Azure DevOps auto-links code to work items.
- Every review finding becomes its own work item with a disposition field, linked to the PoD Feature. This is the audit spine.
- The PR links the work items it resolves; merge updates their state.
- Sign-offs (G1, G2, G4, G7) are recorded as comments or state transitions with the approver's identity and timestamp.

The `azure-traceability` skill defines how Claude creates and links these work items.

---

## 11. The "when unsure, ask" protocol

AI agents must not guess. An agent is **unsure** when any of the following is true:

- A requirement is ambiguous or contradicts another requirement or the existing code.
- More than one reasonable design exists and the choice has meaningful consequences.
- Context is missing (an interface, a data contract, an external system's behaviour, a credential boundary).
- The change touches security, privacy, money, data deletion, access control, or anything irreversible.
- A review finding's correct fix is genuinely unclear.

When unsure, the agent **stops, states what it knows, states precisely what it does not know, and asks the Human Lead a specific question** — ideally with options and trade-offs. It does not proceed on an assumption. The question and its answer are recorded against the PoD so the decision is part of the audit trail.

This is enforced in `CLAUDE.md` and in every skill.

---

## 12. Records & audit evidence

For each PoD, the following are retained and linked (this is the evidence an ISO 27001 auditor will sample):

- Signed-off requirements and design notes (G1).
- Daily Status Reports (N/A)
- Commit history and PR with human approval record (G2, G6).
- Codex independent review report (G3).
- Remediation log: every finding with its disposition, owner, and date (G4).
- Test suite and coverage report (G5).
- CI run results on PR and pushes (G6).
- Approved documentation diff (G7).
- Azure DevOps work item graph linking all of the above.

Records are retained per the organisation's information-security retention policy.

## 13. ISO/IEC 27001:2022 control mapping

This maps process elements to Annex A controls **as a design aid**. It is not a compliance certification. Validate against your organisation's Statement of Applicability and ISMS, and confirm wording with your auditor — control applicability is determined by your risk assessment, not by this table.
