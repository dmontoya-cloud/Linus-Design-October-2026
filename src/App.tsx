/**
 * Login → Verify Email (magic-link mock) → Legal Intro → Terms of Use →
 * Privacy Policy → Setting Up (spinner) → Thanks (spinner) → Onboarding
 * (registration) → Education → Gender & Identity → Dashboard are real
 * screens, gated by AuthContext's mock auth. Legal Intro is a brief,
 * conversational heads-up ("you'll need to agree to some things") before
 * the two-step Terms/Privacy flow, not a step of its own. There is no
 * separate Consent step — Terms of Use and Privacy Policy's own agreement
 * checkboxes cover that (see TermsOfUsePage / PrivacyPolicyPage), and the
 * age-18+ checkbox now lives on Registration, next to date of birth.
 * Setting Up and Thanks are both brief non-interactive beats between
 * agreeing to Privacy Policy and landing on the registration form — Setting
 * Up marks that consent was recorded, Thanks greets the visitor by the
 * preferred name they gave on Legal Intro. Registration, Education, and
 * Gender & Identity together make up the Profile: Registration collects
 * name/date of birth and Education collects education level, both passing
 * their answers forward in router state; Gender & Identity collects
 * gender/sex assigned at birth and saves the whole thing at once — ordered
 * last rather than second, on request, since sex assigned at birth is the
 * more sensitive of the two mid-funnel questions — then hands off to
 * Loading, a last spinner beat before Dashboard appears. Assessment Intro
 * (reached from Memory & Thinking's own Details screen, `MemoryThinkingDetailsPage`'s "I'm
 * ready") is real too — a Device Setup mic-permission step (`DeviceSetupPage`, reinstated on
 * request after having been archived) followed by a click-through recreation of the real
 * assessment task screens (Immediate Recall, Category Fluency, Backward Digit Span, Delayed
 * Recall, Delayed Recognition), on request: no real microphone/audio recording, no voice
 * grading, no real timers, just Next/Continue advancing — see `MemoryThinkingTaskPage`'s own doc
 * comment. An earlier version of this same activity spoke its instructions aloud via the
 * browser's own speech synthesis and ran a real live microphone check before it; that whole flow
 * was archived (see `archive/memory-thinking-device-setup-voiceover` in git) and replaced by
 * this leaner pair of screens, on request, rather than kept alongside it — `DeviceSetupPage`
 * itself is the one exception that's genuinely real: it calls the browser's actual microphone
 * permission API (see its own doc comment) rather than recreating that prompt as a mockup.
 * Report is still a PoD-4 stub, as are
 * History/Settings (reachable only from Dashboard's own nav, not listed in this funnel).
 * There's no paywall or subscription in this product, so no stub for one is listed here either.
