    <strong>1. Information we collect.</strong> We collect your name, email, date of birth,
    education level, and sex assigned at birth, plus the answers and results from every check-in you
    complete. Gender is the only optional field, and it is used solely to determine how we address
    you — it has no effect on your results. We do not collect any other personal information beyond
    what is described here.
  </>,
  <>
    <strong>2. Why we need each piece.</strong> Your name and email attach your identity to your
    report so it can be returned to you. Your date of birth, education level, and sex assigned at
    birth are used only to place your results in an appropriate comparison group, since brain health
    check-ins are read relative to people of similar age, background, and education.
  </>,
  <>
    <strong>3. How we use your information.</strong> Your information is used only to generate your
    report and to operate the Linus Health service itself — for example, to remember your check-in
    history so your report can show change over time. We do not use your information to build an
    advertising profile, and we do not use it for any purpose you have not agreed to here.
  </>,
  <>
    <strong>4. We never sell your information.</strong> We do not sell your information to
    advertisers, insurers, or employers, under any circumstances, and we never use your health
    information for advertising purposes. This applies to all of the information described in
    Section 1, without exception.
  </>,
  <>
    <strong>5. Who sees it.</strong> Access to your information is limited to our team members who
    need it to operate Linus Health, and to trusted service providers bound by contract to the same
    protections described in this policy. We disclose your information to anyone else — including a
    doctor or family member — only at your explicit request.
  </>,
  <>
    <strong>6. Data retention.</strong> We keep your information for as long as your account is
    active, so that your report can reflect your full check-in history. If you close your account,
    we delete your personal information within a reasonable period, except where we are required to
    retain it for a legal or regulatory reason.
  </>,
  <>
    <strong>7. Your rights and choices.</strong> You can review, correct, or request deletion of
    your information at any time by contacting us. If you opted in to marketing emails, you can
    unsubscribe at any time using the link in any email we send, with no effect on your ability to
    use Linus Health.
  </>,
  <>
    <strong>8. Children&apos;s privacy.</strong> Linus Health is intended for adults aged 18 and
    over and is not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under
    18; if we learn that we have, we will delete it promptly.
  </>,
  <>
    <strong>9. Changes to this policy.</strong> If we make a material change to how we collect or
    use your information, we will let you know before it takes effect, the same way we would for a
    material change to our Terms of Use.
  </>,
  <>
    <strong>10. Contact us.</strong> If you have questions about this policy or want to exercise any
    of the rights described in Section 7, you can reach us through the contact details provided in
    the app or on the Linus Health website.

/**
 * Privacy Policy — step 2 of the pre-registration legal flow (Terms of Use,
 * then Privacy Policy), reached from Terms of Use. The full legal text sits
 * inline as plain text (`LegalTextBox`) rather than behind a "Read full
 * text" link or Modal, so it's visible without an extra click. The Privacy
 * Policy agreement checkbox is enabled from the start — it used to stay
 * disabled until scrolled to the end of the full text, but that scroll-gate
 * was removed on request. There is no separate Consent step, and no
 * separate assessment-results consent checkbox either (removed on request)
 * — the Privacy Policy agreement itself is the only required checkbox here.
 * The optional marketing checkbox does not gate Continue. The age-18+
 * checkbox that used to live on Consent now lives on Login, right after the
 * email field (see LoginPage). Each checkbox here sits in its own
 * full-width white card (the same CheckboxCard used there), so none of them
 * read as floating loose on the page background.
 *
 * "Agree and continue" stays enabled at all times, same as Terms of Use —
 * clicking it with the agreement checkbox unchecked reveals a
 * `content-danger` message below it (the checkbox itself never turns red)
 * rather than the button silently refusing to respond. The checkbox card
 * sits in its own `min-height` slot sized to fit the card with its error
 * message showing, so that message never changes the card's height and
 * pushes the rest of the page down.
