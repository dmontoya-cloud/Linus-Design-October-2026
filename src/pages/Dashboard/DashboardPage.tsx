/**
 * Dashboard — the post-onboarding home screen, reached once Login →
 * Onboarding → Gender & Identity all complete. Deliberately minimal: `DashboardNavBar`'s quiet
 * nav bar (logo, user info, empty center — the Assessment/History/Settings links that used to
 * sit there were removed on request) — shared with Assessment Intro and every other screen
 * reached from here — over a short welcome message (name plus a friendly subline, on request).
 * Below the gradient full-check-in card and the three pending-activity
 * cards sits its own "Learn more about brain health" heading, then `ResourcesCard`, a fourth,
 * plainer card pointing to the real Linus Health website for browsable content — the one
 * genuine external link in this prototype. Everything below the nav bar cascades in on mount —
 * the welcome title, the full-check-in card, the "Explore one area" heading and its subtext,
 * each of the three activity cards in turn, then the resources heading and card — the same
 * fade-rise-staggered-by-`cascadeDelay` rhythm the Terms of Use/Privacy Policy/Registration
 * flow already uses, so the whole app shares one entrance style rather than this page
 * appearing all at once while everything before it cascades. The full check-in button and
 * Memory & Thinking's Start both hand off to the real Assessment Intro screen (`/assessment`);
 * Lifestyle/Priorities' Start buttons and History/Settings are still PoD-4+ stubs, same as the
 * other placeholders reachable from the prototype index.
 *
 * `PostReportSurvey` renders as a fixed bottom-right card once `location.state.showSurvey` is
 * set, on request — only `ReportPage`'s Download button hands off with that flag, so the survey
 * shows once an actual download happens, not on every Dashboard visit. Delayed by
 * `SURVEY_DELAY_MS` after mount, on request, so Dashboard itself loads and settles first rather
 * than the survey pushing in at the same instant as everything else's own cascade-in.
