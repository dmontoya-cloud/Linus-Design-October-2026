/** Full-width hero card at the top of the Dashboard, pointing to the complete three-part
 * check-in (Memory, Lifestyle, Priorities) rather than any single activity below it — the
 * dark, high-contrast treatment is deliberate so it reads as the primary way in, not just
 * another card in the grid. The title itself changes per `completedCount` (see
 * `titleLinesFor`), on request — a two-line "status, then what's next" headline once anything's
 * done, matching `ReportReadyPage`'s own headline pattern, rather than one generic title
 * regardless of progress. Each category gets a leading icon and its own progress track,
 * on request — a completed category (per `useAuth().completedActivityIds`) fills its track
 * solid `success` green, and the "X/3 complete" summary below is a real computed count, not a
 * fixed "0/3" display. Once at least one category is done, the next incomplete one in order
 * gets a "Next" label beside its title, on request — pointing at where to go, not just showing
 * what's finished. The main CTA relabels to "Start Next Activity" once anything's done, on
 * request, rather than staying "Start Activity" forever regardless of progress, and hands off to
 * whichever category is actually next (`nextActivity`) rather than always Memory & Thinking's
 * own `startPath` — once all three are done, on request, it relabels again to "Create my report"
 * and points at `/report/building` instead, since there's no more "next activity" to start but
 * generating the combined report is still the primary action. A secondary "Create my report"
 * button (same label as the main CTA once it takes over that role, on request — previously
 * "Generate report") appears beside it while at least one activity is done and at least one
 * still isn't — a report can be generated the moment the first activity is complete, not only
 * once all three are — but disappears once all three are done, on request, since the main CTA
 * has already relabeled to the same thing by then, leaving one CTA rather than two competing
 * (and now identically-labeled) actions. Both point at `/report/building` (not straight to
 * `/report`), on request, so clicking either one always sits through the same loading
 * interstitial before landing on the real report, regardless of which one got you there.
 * `ActivityCard`'s own completed-state action is a
 * secondary "Redo activity" instead, on request, since redoing is that per-activity card's more
 * relevant next step.
 *
 * Once a report has actually been built and downloaded (`useAuth().hasBuiltReport`, set by
 * `ReportPage`'s Download button), on request, neither "Create my report" CTA re-offers building
 * the same report again: the secondary button disappears entirely (matching the "at least one
 * activity is done and at least one still isn't" condition it already required), and once all
 * three are done, the main CTA relabels to "View report" and points straight at `/report`
 * instead of sitting through `/report/building` again for a report that's already built. Either
 * CTA reappears the moment a newly completed activity makes the existing report stale —
 * `completeActivity` resets `hasBuiltReport` to `false` for exactly this reason — including via
 * `ReportReadyPage`'s "Go to Dashboard", which finishes an activity without building, on
 * request: that's the one path that leaves the button showing. */
/** The title's own copy per `completedCount`, on request — one and two done are each a single
 * line; all three done keeps the two-line "status, then what's next" treatment
 * `ReportReadyPage`'s own `headlineLines` uses, since "All activities are in!" reads as its own
 * short beat before the instruction that follows it. Once the report has actually been built
 * (`hasBuiltReport`, set by `ReportPage`'s Download button), on request, this overrides that
 * all-three-done copy with a single "Your report is ready!" line — the "Create your full brain
 * health report" instruction no longer applies once that's already happened, matching the main
 * CTA's own switch to "View report" for the same condition. */
