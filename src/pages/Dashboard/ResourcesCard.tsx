/**
 * ResourcesCard — a standalone block at the end of the Dashboard, below the pending-activity
 * grid, pointing to the real Linus Health website for free-to-browse brain health content.
 * Styled as a plain white card (`--color-surface`, `radius-xl`, `shadow-card`) — the same
 * recipe as `ActivityCard` above it — rather than the gradient `FullCheckInCard` uses, so it
 * reads as "one more card on this page," not another hero moment. The link is a real
 * `<a target="_blank">` (not client-side routing) since it genuinely leaves the app; the
 * external-link icon and copy both call that out so it's never a surprise. The link uses
 * `secondary` — the design system's blue-outline pill — on request, replacing `outline` (a
 * neutral grey-bordered pill meant for quiet actions like Terms of Use/Privacy Policy's own
 * "Back") which read as detached from the rest of the page's blue accent. Applied via
 * `buttonClassName` directly to a real `<a>`, same as `ActivityCard`'s own "Start" link. Two
 * columns: title + copy on the left, the button alone on the right (vertically centered against
 * the text block), stacking back to one column on narrow viewports the same way
 * `FullCheckInCard`'s own category grid does.
