 * built (`hasBuiltReport`, set by `ReportPage`'s Download button), on request, this overrides the
 * all-three-done copy with a single "Your report is ready!" line — the "Create your full brain
 * health report" instruction no longer applies once that's already happened, matching the main
 * CTA's own switch to "View report" for the same condition. */

/**
 * FullCheckInCardV2 — Dashboard 2's rebuilt hero card, per the Figma mock at node 884:2881: one
 * merged white card holding both the header (title, duration/progress line, and the main CTA)
 * and, directly inside the same card below a divider, the three-activity row (`ActivityCardV2`)
 * — replacing Dashboard 1's separate progress-bar tracker and its own standalone activity-card
 * grid below the hero. The secondary "Create my report" button Dashboard 1's `FullCheckInCard`
 * shows beside its main CTA is dropped here on request — the mock shows only one button in this
 * card at any state, since that role now belongs to the new `ReportCTACard` section instead.
 *
 * The main CTA keeps `FullCheckInCard`'s same progress logic, on request now reading "Start First
 * Activity" with nothing done rather than the plain "Start Activity" `FullCheckInCard` still
 * uses, "Start Next Activity" pointing at whichever activity is next once something
 * is, "Create my report" once all three are done and nothing's been built yet, and "View report"
 * once it has (`useAuth().hasBuiltReport`) — see that component's own doc comment for the full
 * reasoning. The header title now also carries over `FullCheckInCard`'s own 3-state title copy
 * (`titleLinesFor`) that changes with progress, on request — the duration line stays static
 * ("About 20 minutes" total, not a remaining-time count), which is still an assumption.
