 * In-app report — the real destination `BuildingReportPage` hands off to once its loading
 * interstitial finishes, on request: same page chrome (`.page`/`.logo`/`.content`) and title/
 * subtitle treatment as `BuildingReportPage`/`ReportReadyPage`, "following the same rules" per
 * that request, rather than a one-off layout — this is the third and final screen in that same
 * building → ready-to-generate → report sequence. The icon plays once (`autoplay`, no `loop` —
 * a one-shot reveal, not a continuous loop like the loading animation) at `.iconLg`, on request
 * matched to `BuildingReportPage`'s own loading icon size, so it doesn't visibly jump on the
 * hand-off between the two — `ReportReadyPage`'s own success checkmark used to share this size
 * too but has since been sized down on its own (`.iconSuccess`). Both also share `.icon`'s own
 * fade-rise-on-mount entrance, so this page arrives the same way every other screen in this
 * sequence does rather than snapping in. No real PDF exists in this prototype, so clicking
 * "Download my report (PDF)" shows the button's own built-in `loading` spinner (see
 * `Button`'s doc comment) for `DOWNLOAD_DELAY_MS`, then navigates to Dashboard — standing in for
 * a real download, same guessed-timer caveat as this funnel's other stand-ins (e.g.
 * `BuildingReportPage`'s `REPORT_DELAY_MS`). Disabled while downloading, on request, so it can't
 * be re-clicked mid-"download"; "Go to Dashboard" stays enabled throughout since it's a real,
 * immediate exit rather than part of the download flow. Clicking Download also calls
 * `useAuth().markReportBuilt`, on request — Dashboard's `FullCheckInCard` reads this to stop
 * offering "Create my report" once one has actually been downloaded, only offering it again once
 * a newly completed activity makes `hasBuiltReport` stale (see that flag's own doc comment).
 * Once the download "finishes", on request, it hands off to Dashboard with
 * `location.state.showSurvey`, so `DashboardPage` can show `PostReportSurvey` — a short feedback
 * card — only after an actual download, not on every Dashboard visit. "Go to Dashboard" is the
 * same plain
 * `tertiary` variant `ReportReadyPage` uses for its own exit button, on request, reusing
 * `.readyActions` for the same side-by-side layout — this is the one screen in the sequence a
 * visitor can actually leave from without generating anything further, so it gets its own way
 * back to Dashboard where the other two intentionally don't. The second paragraph below the main
 * one uses `.helperText`, on request set to the smallest size in the paragraph type scale, rather
 * than reusing `.subtitle` for both.
