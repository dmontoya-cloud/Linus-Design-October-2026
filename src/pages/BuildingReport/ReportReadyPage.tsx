 * interstitial in between any more, on request: this page and `BuildingReportPage` (the loading
 * animation at `/report/building`) used to be one page with an in-place "building" → "ready"
 * transition, which meant finishing an activity always sat through a 30-second fake loading
 * screen before showing what it actually finished. They're now two separate screens —
 * `BuildingReportPage` is reached only from this page's own "Create my report" button below (or
 * Dashboard's own identically-labeled CTA once all three activities are done, via
 * `FullCheckInCard`), standing in for someone actually asking for their report rather than just
 * finishing an activity. No `DashboardNavBar` or other chrome, same as Loading/Setting Up/Thanks.
 * Both exit buttons — "Go to Dashboard" and "Create my report" — call `completeActivity` for
 * whichever activity was just finished (see `completedActivityId` below) before navigating on, so
 * Dashboard's own card/tracker reflect it either way; previously only "Go to Dashboard" did
 * this, which would have left the just-finished activity unrecorded for anyone who clicked
 * straight through to "Create my report" instead. "Go to Dashboard" is always the plain `tertiary`
 * button variant; "Create my report" switches from `secondary` (an outline pill — matching Figma's
 * reference frames for the two "activities remain" states) to `primary` (solid) once nothing's
 * left to recommend, on request — generating the report only becomes the one obvious action once
 * there's nothing else to do first. The headline, intro copy (`INTRO_COPY`), and `ALL_ACTIVITIES`
 * nudges all key off that same id plus `completedActivityIds`, on request — reached after
 * finishing Lifestyle or Priorities (not just the original Memory & Thinking "Skip to report"
 * shortcut), this page shouldn't keep suggesting an activity that's already done.
