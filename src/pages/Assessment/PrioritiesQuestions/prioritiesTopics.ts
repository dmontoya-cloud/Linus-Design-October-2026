/** The Priorities questionnaire's content, transcribed from the Figma "Priorities" section
 * (node 599:6497) in reading order — this repo's only source for this content, since there's
 * no real backend or question bank behind this mock-data prototype. Five named topics (each
 * its own instructions screen, then a free-text answer screen), followed by "Other" (answer
 * only, optional, no instructions screen of its own), then a "Top five" ranking of every answer
 * written across those six topics, then a confidence rating for each of the five chosen
 * answers, then a closing yes/no question — see `PrioritiesQuestionsPage`'s own doc comment for
 * how these are sequenced into the 13 numbered steps Figma's own progress bar shows. */
